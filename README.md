Ripped parts of my heart

Ayy don't mind but I was raised like that
So I guess I never really wanna changed like that
 Be takin' shots to my brain like that
Blacked out drunk and I go like that
Help for me to get through all the pain like that
Yeah, driving through the rain like that
Running from the fame like that
On the front page like that
I'ma go insane like

You know I love my candy, ooo yass
I need it more than I like Mandy, yeah
Stay up, take the charge, yeah
I'm tryin to fix this mistake, yeah
You know I keep that candy, yeahhh I do
I need it more than I like Mandy, yeahhh
Stay up, take charge 
I'm tryin to fix this mistake
I'm being in my mind one more time,
Ripped up the parts from my heart
